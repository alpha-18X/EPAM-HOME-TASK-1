            <h2>CSK beat Lucknow by 12 runs register first IPL win</h2>
            <p>posted on 3 April, 2023 (sports)</p>
            <p class="txt">Chennai Super Kings defeated Lucknow Super Giants by 12 runs for their first win of the season. Ruturaj Gaikwad slammed his second successive fifty and shared 110 runs for the opening wicket with Devon Conway (47 off 29) as CSK posted a commanding 217 for 7 after being sent into bat. Opening the innings, Gaikwad, after his 92 in the opening game, smashed 57 off 31 with three fours and four sixes. Conway, who struck five boundaries and two hits over the fence, gave him good support. Spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3/28) and Mark Wood (3/49) scalped three wickets apiece for LSG. Chasing the target, Kyle Mayers made a whirlwind 22-ball 53 and shared 79 runs for 5.3 overs with skipper KL Rahul (20)

            <h2>Ukraine continues Bakhmut fight as Kyiv mocks Russian claim of capture</h2>
            <p>posted on 2 April , 2023 (global)</p>
            <p class="txt">Ukraine scorned Russian claims to have captured the eastern city of Bakhmut on Monday, saying its foes had raised a victory flag over “some kind of toilet” while combat was raging.

                The battle for Bakhmut has been one of the bloodiest of the conflict, now in its second year, with many casualties on both sides and the city largely destroyed by bombardments.
                
                Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary force spearheading the siege, said on Sunday his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city-center administrative building even though Ukrainian soldiers still held some positions.

            <p>posted on 1 April, 2023 (science)</p>
            <p class="txt">On the morning of April 2, 2023, the Indian Space Research Organisation and its partners successfully demonstrated a precise landing experiment for a Reusable Launch Vehicle at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR), Chitradurga, Karnataka.

                The Reusable Launch Vehicle Autonomous Landing Mission (RLV LEX) test was the second of five tests that are a part of ISRO’s efforts to develop RLVs, or space planes/shuttles, which can travel to low earth orbits to deliver payloads and return to earth for use again.
